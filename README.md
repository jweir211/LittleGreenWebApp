# LittleGreenWebApp

For our web application we will be designing several pages with different purposes.
Our group has decided upon 3 final ideas, such as a map displaying eco-friendly business'
in the Dundee area that could either support a waste-free lifestyle or other eco-friendly
ways of living. Another idea we are planning on implementing is a quiz that asks the user
about their lifestyle and then gives them feedback based on this about how to improve their
daily habits. The last idea/page we will implement is a selections of recipe's on a carousel
that can be bought from the little green larder.
